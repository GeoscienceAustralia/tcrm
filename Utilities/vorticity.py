    Calling Sequence:
        Result = deriv([x_in,] y_in, missing=1e+20, algorithm='default')


    Positional Input Arguments:
    * x_in:  Abscissa values of y_in to take with respect to.  If 
      not set, the derivative of y_in is take with respect to unit 
      abscissa intervals.  Numeric array of same shape and size as 
      y_in.  Must be monotonic and with no duplicate values.
      Optional.  First positional argument out of two, if present.

    * y_in:  Ordinate values, to take the derivative with respect 
      to.  Numeric array vector of rank 1.  Required.  Second posi-
      tional argument, if x_in is present; only positional argument 
      if x_in is absent.


    Keyword Input Arguments:
    * missing:  If y_in and/or x_in has missing values, this is the 
      missing value value.  Scalar.  Default is 1e+20.

    * algorithm:  Name of the algorithm to use.  String scalar.
      Default is 'default'.  Possible values include:
      + 'default':  Default method (currently set to 'order1').
      + 'order1':  First-order finite-differencing (backward and
        forward differencing used at the endpoints, and centered
        differencing used everywhere else).  If abscissa intervals
        are irregular, differencing will be correspondingly asym-
        metric.


    Output Result:
    * Derivative of y_in with respect to x_in (or unit interval 
      abscissa, if x_in is not given).  Numeric array of same shape 
      and size as y_in.  If there are missing values, those elements 
      in the output are set to the value in |missing|.  For instance, 
      if y_in is only one element, a one-element vector is returned 
      as the derivative with the value of |missing|.  If there are 
      missing values in the output due to math errors and |missing| 
      is set to None, output will fill those missing values with the 
      MA default value of 1e+20.

    """Curl of a vector F on a 2-D "rectangular" grid.

    The 2-D grid F is defined on is rectangular, meaning that while
    the grid spacings do not have to be even, each grid box is
    rectangular and grid boundaries are rectilinear and parallel to
    each other.  If the 2-D grid is on a sphere, we assume that lines
    of constant longitude and latitude form grids that are rectangular
    (though in reality this is not strictly true).

    Since F does not have a z-component, the curl of F is positive
    pointing as a normal out of the plane defined by the basis for 
    x and y.


    Positional Input Arguments:
    * x:  x-coordinate of each F.  1-D Numeric array with number of 
      elements equal to the number of columns in array F.  Typically 
      x is in km, or on a sphere the longitude in deg.  Floating or
      integer type.

    * y:  y-coordinate of each F.  1-D Numeric array with number of 
      elements equal to the number of rows in array F.  Typically 
      y is in km, or on a sphere the latitude in deg.  Floating or
      integer type.

    * Fx:  x-component of vector quantity F.  2-D Numeric array of 
      shape (len(y), len(x)).  Floating or integer type.

    * Fy:  y-component of vector quantity F.  2-D Numeric array of 
      same shape and size as Fx.  Floating or integer type.


    Keyword Input Arguments:
    * missing:  If Fx and/or Fy has missing values, this is the 
      missing value value.  Scalar.  Default is 1e+20.

    * algorithm:  Name of the algorithm to use.  String scalar.
      Default is 'default'.  Possible values include:

      + 'default':  Default method.  Algorithm 'order1_cartesian' 
        is used.

      + 'default_spherical':  If 'spherepack' can be used, chooses
        that method.  Otherwise 'order1_spherical' is used.  Either
        way this option assumes the domain is on a sphere of radius
        equal to keyword R_sphere.

      + 'order1_cartesian':  First-order finite-differencing (back-
        ward and forward differencing used at the endpoints, and 
        centered differencing used everywhere else).  If abscissa 
        intervals are irregular, differencing will be correspon-
        dingly asymmetric.  Grid is assumed Cartesian.  The curl
        returned is in units of F divided by the units of x and y
        (x and y must be in the same units).

      + 'order1_spherical':  First-order finite-differencing (back-
        ward and forward differencing used at the endpoints, and 
        centered differencing used everywhere else).  If abscissa 
        intervals are irregular, differencing will be correspon-
        dingly asymmetric.  Grid is assumed spherical and x and y
        are longitude and latitude (in deg).  The curl returned is 
        in units of F divided by units of R_sphere.  Note because
        of singularities in the algorithm near the poles, the
        curl for all points north of 88N or south of 88S latitude 
        are set to missing.

      + 'spherepack':  The NCAR package SPHEREPACK 3.0 is used for 
        calculating the curl.  The spatial domain is the global 
        sphere; x and y are longitude and latitude (in deg), 
        respectively; x must be evenly spaced and y must be gauss-
        ian or evenly spaced.  The domain must cover the entire 
        sphere and x and y must be longitude and latitude, respec-
        tively, in deg.  There can be no missing values.  The 
        algorithm also assumes that x and y are monotonically in-
        creasing from index 0.  The curl returned is in units of F 
        divided by m.  Thus, if F is velocity in m/s, the curl of 
        F is in units 1/s (and is the vorticity).  Note that in 
        this function's implementation, the final curl output using 
        algorithm 'spherepack' is adjusted for R_sphere not equal 
        to the default mean earth radius, if appropriate, so this 
        algorithm can be used on other planets.

        Note that SPHEREPACK operates on single precision floating
        point (Float32) values.  This function silently converts
        input to Float32 for the computations, as needed (the input 
        parameters are not altered, however).

    * R_sphere:  If the grid is the surface of a sphere, this is 
      the radius of the sphere.  This keyword is only used when 
      the algorithm is 'order1_spherical' or 'spherepack' (either 
      chosen explicitly by the algorithm keyword or automatically 
      when 'default_spherical' is used).  Default value is the 
      "mean" radius of the Earth, in meters.  "Mean" is in quotes
      because this value changes depending on what you consider the
      mean; the default in this function is the same Earth radius
      used in module sphere.  Note that if the level is a distance 
      z above the "mean" radius of the earth, R_sphere should be 
      set to the "mean" radius plus z.  
      
      Value can be a scalar or a Numeric or MA array of the same 
      size and shape as Fx.  If keyword is an array, the value of
      R_sphere for each element corresponds to the same location
      as in the Fx and Fy arrays; there should also be no missing 
      values in R_sphere (function doesn't check for this, however).


    Output:
    * Curl of F.  Units depend on algorithm used to calculate curl
      (see above discussion of keyword algorithm).  Numeric array of 
      same shape as Fx and Fy inputs.  
      
      If there are missing values, those elements in the output that 
      used missing values in the calculation of the curl are set to 
      the value in keyword missing.  If there are missing values in 
      the output due to math errors and keyword missing is set to 
      None, output will fill those missing values with the MA default 
      value of 1e+20.

    >>> v = N.sin((x_2d-30.)*N.pi/180.)*N.sin((y_2d-90.)*N.pi/30.)
    >>> N.putmask( u, N.where(N.absolute(u) < 1e-10, 1, 0), 0. )
    >>> N.putmask( v, N.where(N.absolute(v) < 1e-10, 1, 0), 0. )
    >>> N.putmask( u, N.where(N.absolute(y_2d) > 60., 1, 0), 0. )
    >>> N.putmask( v, N.where(N.absolute(y_2d) > 60., 1, 0), 0. )

    (b) Use order 1 Cartesian algorithm:  If x and y are in meters,
        and u and v are in m/s, the curl is in 1/s:

    >>> curl = curl_2d(x, y, u, v, algorithm='order1_cartesian')
    >>> ['%.7g' % curl[45,i] for i in range(88,92)]
    ['-0.007251593', '-0.003628007', '0', '0.003628007']
    >>> ['%.7g' % curl[0,i]  for i in range(8,12)]
    ['0', '0', '0', '0']

    (c) Use spectral method from SPHEREPACK (need to first remove the
        repeating dateline point from the domain).  Here we take x and
        y in deg, while u and v are in m/s.  If so the curl is in 1/s.
        These results as much less than for example (b) above since
        the domain is much larger:

    >>> x = x[0:-1]
    >>> u = u[:,0:-1]
    >>> v = v[:,0:-1]
    >>> curl = curl_2d(x, y, u, v, algorithm='spherepack')
    >>> ['%.7g' % curl[45,i] for i in range(88,92)]
    ['-6.436402e-08', '-3.220152e-08', '1.33852e-13', '3.220165e-08']
    >>> ['%.7g' % curl[0,i]  for i in range(8,12)]
    ['-2.299736e-20', '-4.806512e-21', '-9.283145e-22', '-1.368445e-20']

    (d) Use order 1 spherical algorithm:  x and y are in deg and u and
        v are in m/s.  The curl is in 1/s.  Note that these results are
        nearly identical to those from SPHEREPACK, except near the poles
        the values are set to missing:

    >>> curl = curl_2d(x, y, u, v, algorithm='order1_spherical')
    >>> ['%.7g' % curl[45,i] for i in range(88,92)]
    ['-6.517317e-08', '-3.260645e-08', '0', '3.260645e-08']
    >>> ['%.7g' % curl[0,i]  for i in range(8,12)]
    ['1e+20', '1e+20', '1e+20', '1e+20']

    (e) Use "default" algorithm, which for this domain chooses the 
        order 1 cartesian algorithm:

    >>> curl = curl_2d(x, y, u, v, algorithm='default')
    >>> ['%.7g' % curl[45,i] for i in range(88,92)]
    ['-0.007251593', '-0.003628007', '0', '0.003628007']

    (f) Use "default_spherical" algorithm with missing data (equal to
        1e+20), which because of the missing data will choose the order
        1 spherical algorithm.  We also do the calculation on Mars, and
        illustrate passing in the radius as a constant as well as an
        array of the same size and shape as u and v:

    >>> u[30:46,90:114] = 1e+20
    >>> curl = curl_2d( x, y, u, v, algorithm='default_spherical' \
                      , R_sphere=3390e+3)
    >>> ['%.7g' % curl[45,i] for i in range(88,92)]
    ['-1.224875e-07', '-6.128107e-08', '1e+20', '1e+20']

    >>> R_mars = N.zeros(u.shape, typecode=N.Float) + 3390e+3
    >>> curl = curl_2d( x, y, u, v, algorithm='default_spherical' \
                      , R_sphere=R_mars )
    >>> ['%.7g' % curl[45,i] for i in range(88,92)]
    ['-1.224875e-07', '-6.128107e-08', '1e+20', '1e+20']
