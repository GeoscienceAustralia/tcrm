   Annual Exceedance Probability
      The probability of a threshold being exceeded once (or more) in any
      year. 

   Genesis
      Formation of a tropical cyclone event.

   Hazard
      The magnitude of wind speed. TCRM generates a 3-second gust wind
      speed, at 10 metres above ground over open, flat terrain (an
      aerodynamic roughness length of 0.02 m).

   Kernel density estimation
      A non-parametric method to estimate the probability density
      function of a random variable. 

   Lysis
      Termination of a tropical cyclone event. Can be caused by the tropical 
      cyclone weakening through stochastic process, landfall decay or exiting 
      the defined domain.

   mpirun
      mpirun is a runtime environment for the Message Passing Interface (MPI).
      See http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpi/

   Pypar
      PyPar is a python library that provides efficient and scalable 
      parallelism using the message passing interface (MPI) to handle
      big data and highly computational problems. See
      http://github.com/daleroberts/pypar

   Return period
      The average time between exceedances of a given threshold. Compare to
      Annual Exceedance Probability. 

   Tropical cyclone
      A tropical cyclone is a rapidly-rotating storm system characterized by 
      a low-pressure center, strong winds, and a spiral arrangement of 
      thunderstorms that produce heavy rain.
