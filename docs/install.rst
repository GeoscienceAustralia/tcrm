.. _installation:

Installation
============

Installing TCRM is intended to be a simple process, requiring only a
small amount of compilation and basic understanding of command line
operations. TCRM has been installed and (lightly) tested on a range of
unix-based systems, Windows and Mac OS/X systems.

.. _downloading:

Downloading
----------

The TCRM code can be downloaded from the `Geoscience Australia GitHub
page <https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/tcrm>`_.

For users wanting to only run the code, a zip file or gzipped tar file
of the latest releases can be downloaded from the `Releases page
<https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/tcrm/releases>`_.

Those wanting to contribute to development can `fork
<https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/tcrm/fork>`_ the
repository. Submit a pull request to have your changes integrated into
TCRM.

.. _environment:

Setting the environment
----------------------

To enable TCRM to run flawlessly, you may need to change some
environment settings. The important variable to set is the
``PYTHONPATH`` variable. This should be set to the path where you have
extracted the contents of the zip file. In the examples below, change
``/path/to/tcrm`` to the location where you extracted the TCRM files.

A complete discussion on environment variables in Python is given in
the `Python documentation
<https://docs.python.org/2/using/cmdline.html#environment-variables>`_.

Windows
~~~~~~~

The Python documentation contains some simple instructions for setting
environment variables on Windows systems `here
<https://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html>`_. See `this link
<http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm>`_ for setting the
variables on different Windows systems.

BASH shell
~~~~~~~~~~

::

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/tcrm:/path/to/tcrm/Utilities


CSH/TCSH shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    setenv PYTHONPATH $PYTHONPATH:/path/to/tcrm:/path/to/tcrm/Utilities





.. _dependencies:

Dependencies
-----------

TCRM relies on a number of additional libraries that are not part of
the standard library. There are several ways to obtain the required
libraries -- using Python's recommended tool `pip
<https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_, installing a distribution
such as `Python(x,y) package <http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/>`_
(for Windows environments) or `Anaconda
<https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_ (cross-platform), or
installing the libraries from source or binary installers
(pre-compiled binary Windows installer versions for all the libraries
(both 32-bit and 64-bit) can be obtained `here
<http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>`_).

For detailed instructions on installation of these dependencies,
please see the documentation for each individual library.

* `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ - v2.7 preferred
* `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ - v1.6 or later
* `Scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ - v0.12 or later
* `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ v1.2 or later. 
* `Basemap <http://matplotlib.org/basemap/index.html>`_
* `netcdf4-python <https://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/>`_ -
  version 1.0.8 or later
* `Shapely <http://toblerity.org/shapely/index.html>`_ - v1.2.15 or later
* `statsmodels <http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net>`_ 
* `seaborn <http://seaborn.pydata.org>`_
* `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`_
* `gitpython <http://gitpython.readthedocs.org>`_
* Parallel execution in multi-processor environments (with MPI
  installed) requires `Pypar <http://github.com/daleroberts/pypar>`_

Using pip
~~~~~~~~~

If you have `pip <https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ installed,
the required modules can be installed using the following command,
executed in the main TCRM directory::

   pip -v install -r requirements.txt

This will automatically build the required libraries (listed in the
``requirements.txt`` file) and any dependencies. ``pip`` must be on
the ``$PATH`` for this to work.

.. _compilation:

Compiling the extensions
-----------------------

The model requires a number of C extensions to be compiled before
execution. These can be built using Python's inbuilt :mod:`distutils`
module.


Unix
~~~~
From the base directory, execute the build process::

    python installer/setup.py build_ext -i

Ubuntu
~~~~~~
The github branch issue_25 (created from the v2.0 branch) had an environment created by `installing miniconda
<https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html#linux-miniconda-install>`_ and executing the following commands::

        ~/miniconda2/bin/conda create --name tcrm
        ~/miniconda2/bin/source activate tcrm
        ~/miniconda2/bin/conda install numpy
        ~/miniconda2/bin/conda install scipy
        ~/miniconda2/bin/conda install matplotlib
        ~/miniconda2/bin/conda install basemap
        ~/miniconda2/bin/conda install netcdf4
        ~/miniconda2/bin/conda install shapely
        ~/miniconda2/bin/conda install Tornado
        ~/miniconda2/bin/conda install statsmodel
        ~/miniconda2/bin/conda install seaborn
        ~/miniconda2/bin/pip --proxy=http://localhost:3128 install simplejson


The following libraries were needed to compile the C extensions, and run the unit tests::

    sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-glx
    sudo apt-get install python-numpy-dev

The C extensions were compiled from the trcm directory with::

        (tcrm) user@server:~/tcrm$ python intaller/setup.py build_ext -i

An error occurred where the include file seems to have changed paths. It may be a one off,
or it may reoccur in another version of Linux. The error was in KPDF.c and the change was to
comment out one line and replace it with another.::

        #include "numpy/arrayobject.h"
        /* #include "arrayobject.h" */

A requiremements file was created in the root directory called ``linux_v20.yml`` and should (it hasn't been tested)
replace the ``conda install`` commands above. The command to use this file is::

        conda env create -f linux_v20.yml

Activating the environment would be::

        source activate linux_v20


Windows
~~~~~~~

For Windows users, the code includes the ``compile.cmd`` script in the
main TCRM diretory that will build these extensions in place. By
default, TCRM uses the MinGW suite (http://www.mingw.org) for
compiling the extensions. Other Windows-based packages can also be
used (e.g. Cygwin). See the Python documentation on writing
configuration files for the :mod:`distutils` package for more details.

Notes
~~~~~

It is recommended to use a stand-alone Python installation for
compiling and running TCRM. Installations linked to other software
such as ArcGIS have resulted in compilation errors, as the required
:mod:`numpy` libraries are pre-compiled and packaged with such
installations.

.. _testing:

Testing the installation
-----------------------

The model code includes a suite of unit tests that ensure elements of
the code base will work as expected, even if a user makes
modificaitons to the code.

The test suite can be run from the main directory. On Windows, run the
``run_test_all.cmd`` script from the main TCRM directory. On Unix, use
the command::

    python ./tests/run.py

This should report no errors or failures. 

Special note for Windows systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On a Windows system, :func:`tests.test_files.testModulePath` may fail
due to the different path separators (``/`` versus ``\\``) used by the
Windows system. This test failure will appear as::

    ======================================================================
    FAIL: testModulePath (tests.test_files.TestModuleUtilities)
    Test flModulePath returns correct path, base & extension
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "tcrm\tests\test_files.py", line 22, in testModulePath
        self.assertEqual(self.path, p)
    AssertionError: 'tcrm/tests' != 'tcrm\\tests'

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
    Ran 111 tests in 92.513s

    FAILED (failures=1)

Such an error will not affect model execution.


Using Docker
------------

As an alternative way to install TCRM, you can use Docker.
Docker is a very convenient way to run containerized software which
avoids all the hassle with compilation or dependencies.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install `Docker Community Edition
<https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms>`_ for your
system.

Test the installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run this command ::

    docker run olivierdalang/tcrm nosetests --exe

The first time, this will take some time, as it needs to download the docker image.
If it works, you should see (after some time), something like ``OK (SKIP=1)``.
If not, you would see something like ``FAILED (SKIP=1, errors=1)``.

Normal usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run TCRM though Docker, you need to mount a folders containing your
inputs and the output folder in the container.

This can be done like this (assuming you have a my_conf.ini file in
a folder) ::

    docker run -v /path_to/my_data_folder:/home/src/mount -v /path_to/my_output_folder:/home/src/output olivierdalang/tcrm python tcevent.py -v -c mount/my_conf.ini

Replace ``/path_to/my_data_folder`` and ``/path_to/my_output_folder``
by the folders you want to use on your system, and ``python tcevent.py 
v -c example/yasi.ini`` by the TCRM command you want to use.

The first time, the docker image will have to be downloaded which will
take some time.

Developement
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also use Docker when developping TCRM by mounting the source::

    git checkout https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/tcrm.git
    cd tcrm
    docker run -v ${PWD}:/home/src olivierdalang/tcrm python tcevent.py -c example/yasi.ini

If you wish to make changes to the builds steps or dependencies, you need to rebuild the image locally ::

    docker build -t olivierdalang/tcrm .

Releases
~~~~~~~~

For users to be able to use the docker image out of the box without having to rebuild it locally,
the image must be pushed to the docker hub repository like this ::

    docker build -t olivierdalang/tcrm .
    docker login
    docker push olivierdalang/tcrm

This can be setup to be done automatically after pushes through docker hub.
